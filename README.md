🐍 Snake Game (Python Turtle)

A classic Snake Game built using Python's turtle module, perfect for beginners to learn Python basics like variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and event handling.

🎮 Features

Classic Snake gameplay

Normal food: red circles, worth 10 points

Special food: golden circles, bigger, worth 20 points, appears every 10 seconds, stays until eaten

Snake grows each time it eats food

Score and High Score tracking

Collision detection with walls and snake body

Adjustable game speed

🛠️ Requirements

Python 3.x

Built-in modules only: turtle, time, random

▶️ How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/badrghanjaoui/snake-game.git


Navigate to the project folder:

cd snake-game


Run the game:

python snake.py

⌨️ Controls

Arrow Keys → Move the snake

⬆️ Up = Move Up

⬇️ Down = Move Down

⬅️ Left = Move Left

➡️ Right = Move Right

📚 Python Concepts Used

Variables → track score, delay, snake direction

Functions → movement (goup, godown, goleft, goright, move)

Loops → main game loop (while True)

Conditionals → collision detection with walls, food, and body

Modules →

turtle → graphics and window handling

random → random food placement

time → controlling game speed and special food timer



🚀 Future Improvements

Add levels or difficulty modes

Add sound effects

Save high scores in a file

Add start menu and restart option

Make special food appear randomly in different shapes/colors
